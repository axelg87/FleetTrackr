# Role-Based Access Control Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the role-based access control system that has been implemented in the Fleet Manager app.

## Overview

The app now supports three user roles with different permission levels:

- **DRIVER**: Can only view and create their own entries/expenses. Cannot edit or delete anything.
- **MANAGER**: Can view all data but can only create entries/expenses for themselves. Cannot edit or delete.
- **ADMIN**: Can view, create, edit, and delete everything.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Domain Models

#### UserRole Enum (`domain/model/UserRole.kt`)
- Defines the three user roles with display names
- Includes utility methods for parsing roles from strings

#### RolePermissions Object (`domain/model/UserRole.kt`)
- Centralizes all permission logic
- Provides methods to check what each role can do:
  - `canViewAllData(role)` - Can see all users' data
  - `canEdit(role)` - Can edit entries/expenses
  - `canDelete(role)` - Can delete entries/expenses
  - `canCreate(role)` - Can create entries/expenses
  - `canCreateForOthers(role)` - Can create for other users

#### User Model (`domain/model/User.kt`)
- Represents user data stored in Firestore
- Includes role field and utility methods
- Compatible with Firebase Firestore serialization

### 2. Data Layer

#### UserDto (`data/dto/UserDto.kt`)
- Data transfer object for local Room database
- Includes all user fields plus sync metadata

#### UserDao (`data/local/dao/UserDao.kt`)
- Room DAO for local user data operations
- Supports queries by role, user ID, etc.

#### UserMapper (`data/mapper/UserMapper.kt`)
- Maps between User domain model and UserDto

#### Database Updates (`data/local/FleetManagerDatabase.kt`)
- Added UserDto entity to Room database
- Incremented database version to 4

### 3. Firebase Integration

#### FirestoreService Updates (`data/remote/FirestoreService.kt`)
- Added user management methods:
  - `saveUser()` - Create/update user documents
  - `getUserByUid()` - Fetch user by Firebase UID
  - `getCurrentUser()` - Get current user's data
  - `createUserFromAuth()` - Create user from Firebase Auth data
  - `updateUserRole()` - Admin-only role updates
  - `getAllUsers()` - Admin-only user listing

#### Role-Based Queries
- Updated `getDailyEntries()` and `getExpenses()` to respect user roles
- Added `getDailyEntriesFlowForRole()` and `getExpensesFlowForRole()` methods
- Drivers see only their own data, Managers/Admins see all data

### 4. ViewModels

#### UserRoleViewModel (`ui/viewmodel/UserRoleViewModel.kt`)
- Manages current user's role state
- Automatically creates user documents for first-time sign-ins
- Provides permission checking methods
- Exposes role information to UI components

#### EntryListViewModel Updates (`ui/viewmodel/EntryListViewModel.kt`)
- Integrates with UserRoleViewModel
- Uses role-based Firestore queries
- Exposes permission flags to UI

#### EntryDetailViewModel Updates (`ui/viewmodel/EntryDetailViewModel.kt`)
- Adds role-based permission checks
- Includes delete functionality with authorization
- Prevents unauthorized access to entries

### 5. UI Components

#### EntryListScreen Updates (`ui/screens/entry/EntryListScreen.kt`)
- Shows user role information (for non-drivers)
- Conditionally shows FAB menu based on permissions
- Uses role-aware data queries

#### EntryDetailScreen Updates (`ui/screens/entry/EntryDetailScreen.kt`)
- Adds Edit and Delete buttons in top app bar
- Shows buttons only for authorized users (admins)
- Includes delete confirmation dialog
- Handles delete operations with proper error handling

### 6. Use Cases

#### DeleteDailyEntryUseCase (`domain/usecase/DeleteDailyEntryUseCase.kt`)
- New use case for deleting daily entries
- Used by EntryDetailViewModel for authorized deletions

### 7. Permission Manager

#### PermissionManager (`domain/manager/PermissionManager.kt`)
- Centralized permission checking utility
- Provides convenience methods for all permission types
- Can be used throughout the app for consistent permission checks

## Security Features

### Client-Side Security
- UI components respect user roles and hide unauthorized actions
- ViewModels enforce permission checks before operations
- Data queries are filtered based on user role

### Server-Side Security
- Firebase Security Rules enforce permissions at database level
- Users cannot access unauthorized data even if they bypass UI
- Role-based read/write/delete permissions for all collections

## User Experience

### For Drivers
- See only their own entries and expenses
- Can create new entries and expenses
- Cannot see edit/delete buttons
- Role information is not prominently displayed

### For Managers  
- See all entries and expenses from all users
- Can create their own entries and expenses
- Cannot edit or delete anything
- Role information is displayed to clarify permissions

### For Admins
- Full access to all data and operations
- Can edit and delete any entry or expense
- Can manage user roles (if user management UI is implemented)
- Role information is displayed with full permission details

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `domain/model/UserRole.kt` - Role definitions and permissions
- `domain/model/User.kt` - User domain model
- `data/dto/UserDto.kt` - User data transfer object
- `data/local/dao/UserDao.kt` - User database operations
- `data/mapper/UserMapper.kt` - User model mapping
- `ui/viewmodel/UserRoleViewModel.kt` - Role state management
- `domain/usecase/DeleteDailyEntryUseCase.kt` - Delete entry use case
- `domain/manager/PermissionManager.kt` - Permission utilities
- `ROLE_BASED_SECURITY_RULES.md` - Firebase security rules
- `ROLE_BASED_ACCESS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

### Modified Files
- `data/local/FleetManagerDatabase.kt` - Added UserDto entity
- `data/remote/FirestoreService.kt` - Added user management and role-based queries
- `ui/viewmodel/EntryListViewModel.kt` - Added role integration
- `ui/viewmodel/EntryDetailViewModel.kt` - Added role-based permissions and delete
- `ui/screens/entry/EntryListScreen.kt` - Added role display and conditional UI
- `ui/screens/entry/EntryDetailScreen.kt` - Added edit/delete buttons with permissions

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Set up Firebase Security Rules** - Apply the rules from `ROLE_BASED_SECURITY_RULES.md`

2. **Test with Different Roles** - Create test users with different roles and verify permissions

3. **User Management UI** (Optional) - Create admin screens to manage user roles

4. **Expense Screen Updates** - Apply similar role-based restrictions to expense screens

5. **Audit Logging** (Optional) - Log admin actions for security auditing

6. **Role Assignment Process** - Decide how new users get assigned non-driver roles

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Driver can only see their own data
- [ ] Manager can see all data but cannot edit/delete
- [ ] Admin can perform all operations
- [ ] Firebase security rules prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] UI properly hides unauthorized actions
- [ ] Delete operations work correctly for admins
- [ ] New users are created with default driver role
- [ ] Role information is displayed appropriately

## Security Considerations

- All permission checks are enforced both client-side and server-side
- Firebase Security Rules provide the ultimate security enforcement
- User roles are stored securely in Firestore
- Role changes require admin privileges
- Default role for new users is the most restrictive (driver)

This implementation provides a solid foundation for role-based access control while maintaining good user experience and security practices.
