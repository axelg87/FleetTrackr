    profilePictureUrl: String? = null,
    size: Int = 40,
    onClick: (() -> Unit)? = null
)
```

#### 📝 Profile Information Management

    val isUpdating: Boolean = false,
    val isUploadingPicture: Boolean = false,
    val isEditMode: Boolean = false,
    val error: String? = null,
    val successMessage: String? = null
)
```

## 🔗 Navigation Flow

### Access Points:

- Settings Screen ✅

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Used:
- **Coil**: For image loading and display (`AsyncImage`)
- **Firebase Storage**: For profile picture uploads
- **Firebase Firestore**: For profile data storage
- **Jetpack Compose**: For modern UI implementation
- **Hilt**: For dependency injection
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous operations

### Error Handling:
- Network error handling for uploads
- Authentication validation
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states during operations

### Performance Optimizations:
- Image caching with Coil
- Reactive data flows with StateFlow
- Optimized recompositions with stable lambdas
- Lazy loading of profile data

## 🚀 Ready for Use

The user profile page is now fully implemented and integrated into the app. Users can:

1. **Access their profile** from any screen via the header profile icon
2. **View their information** including name, email, role, and profile picture
3. **Edit their details** using the intuitive edit dialog
4. **Upload profile pictures** with Firebase Storage integration
5. **See real-time updates** across the entire application

The implementation follows best practices for Android development, maintains consistency with the existing codebase, and provides a smooth user experience with proper loading states and error handling.

## 🔄 Firebase Setup Required

Before using the profile picture upload feature, ensure Firebase Storage is properly configured:

1. **Enable Firebase Storage** in the Firebase Console
2. **Configure Storage Rules** (see `StorageService.kt` for details)
3. **Verify Authentication** is working properly

The profile page will work without these, but photo uploads will be disabled until Firebase Storage is configured.
