### Key Design Principles Applied

1. **DRY Principle**: All calculations centralized in `AnalyticsCalculator`
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI, ViewModel, and business logic
3. **State Hoisting**: Stateless components with state managed by ViewModel
4. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows down, events flow up
5. **Reusable Components**: Modular components that can be easily modified or extended

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Excellence
- **Consistent Design**: All components use the same padding, colors, and typography
- **Material 3 Design**: Full Material You theming support
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and progress animations throughout
- **Interactive Elements**: Sortable lists, toggleable views, and detailed breakdowns
