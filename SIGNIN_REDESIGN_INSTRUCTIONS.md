## PNG Logo Integration

### Step 1: Prepare Your PNG Files
Create different sizes of your PNG logo for various screen densities:

- **xxxhdpi (480dpi)**: Largest size for high-density screens
- **xxhdpi (320dpi)**: High-density screens  
- **xhdpi (240dpi)**: Extra high-density screens
- **hdpi (160dpi)**: High-density screens
- **mdpi (120dpi)**: Medium-density screens (baseline)

### Step 2: File Placement
Place your PNG files in the respective directories:

```
app/src/main/res/
├── drawable-xxxhdpi/your_logo.png
├── drawable-xxhdpi/your_logo.png  
├── drawable-xhdpi/your_logo.png
├── drawable-hdpi/your_logo.png
└── drawable-mdpi/your_logo.png
```

### Step 3: Update the Code
In `/app/src/main/java/com/fleetmanager/ui/screens/auth/SignInScreen.kt`, replace:

```kotlin
painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.ic_company_logo),
```

With:

```kotlin
painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.your_logo_name),
```

### Step 4: Size Adjustment (Optional)
If your logo requires different sizing, adjust the modifier:

```kotlin
modifier = Modifier.size(120.dp), // Adjust size as needed
```

## Design Consistency

The new SignIn screen now matches:

- **SplashScreen**: Same black background and AG Motion branding

- **Overall App**: Material Design 3 components and color scheme
